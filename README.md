# CUBIRON
Small format, low cost 3d printer

🧊 Cubiron — Tiny DIY FDM 3D Printer (70x70x70mm)
Cubiron is an ultra-compact, fully DIY 3D printer designed from scratch for minimal cost, minimal size, and maximum learning. With a build volume of just 70×70×70mm, this project is ideal for tinkerers, makers, and experimenters looking to explore the limits of low-cost, small-format FDM printing.
